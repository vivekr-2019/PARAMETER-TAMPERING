# PARAMETER-TAMPERING
SECURING WEB APPLICATION FROM PARAMETER TAMPERING AND ITS PREVENTION


**Background**
Web applications are high-value targets for attackers due to their pervasive use in online commerce, banking, social media, and other critical functions. Parameter tampering is a common attack where adversaries manipulate exchanged data like hidden fields, cookies, and URLs to compromise the application. This exploits weak input validation and session management in many web apps. Parameter tampering can enable exploits including unauthorized access, fraud, and account takeover. Legacy systems are especially vulnerable due to insufficient cryptography and flawed authentication. Lowered barriers through tools like Burp Suite exacerbate the problem. To mitigate risks, developers must implement robust protections including encryption, hashing, and improved session management. This project aims to increase awareness of parameter tampering threats, demonstrate attack techniques, implement cryptographic defenses, analyze their effectiveness, and provide guidance to equip developers with knowledge to build more tamper-resilient web applications.

**Motivation**
Web applications are increasingly targeted via parameter tampering attacks which exploit common flaws like weak validation and cryptography to enable fraud and unauthorized access. High-profile incidents have demonstrated legacy systems are especially vulnerable. This project was driven by the need to increase awareness of parameter tampering threats among developers and provide guidance on implementing robust defenses like encryption, hashing, and enhanced session management. By establishing techniques to analyze and address tampering vulnerabilities, this project aims to equip developers with the knowledge to secure modern web applications. Additionally, this project enables cost-effective assessment of exposure to tampering risks before major incidents occur by providing a model for controlled testing and remediation.

**Project Statement**
This project demonstrates common parameter tampering attack techniques used to manipulate hidden fields, cookies, URLs and other exchanged data to compromise web application security. It implements protections like AES and RSA encryption, SHA hashing, and enhanced session management to defend against tampering of parameters. A prototype web application is developed incorporating these defenses and thoroughly tested to analyze their effectiveness.
The project provides easily accessible guides and demonstrations to increase awareness of parameter tampering threats among developers. By open sourcing reference implementations of cryptographic controls and improved authentication mechanisms, it enables developers to make informed design choices to protect modern web applications
The methodology for systematically evaluating and addressing parameter manipulation establishes a model for comprehensive security analysis of web systems against input-based attacks. Overall, this project aims to equip developers with the knowledge and resources to design secure, tamper-resilient web applications that maintain data integrity in the face of evolving adversaries.

**Objectives**
Making direct link to pages of the payment gateway, transmission of non-encrypted packets, and without maintaining the database for the transactions a vulnerability is open for the attackers to intercept the packets and tamper with the package. So, the main objectives of our project are, to demonstrate how parameter tampering is performed in our own website as well as real-time website using BurpSuite tool. For example, an e-commerce website uses hidden fields to refer to its things, as follows: 
<input type= “hidden” id= “148” name= “price” value= “10000”>
In this example, an attacker can modify the “value” information of a specific item, thus lowering its cost.  
To prevent these packages to be read and tampered for the pages that are linked to the payment gateways and to show how it can be prevented using encryption and hashing, so that even if someone intercepts the package it will be impossible to change the values as they are encrypted and hashed.

**Scope of the Project**
-	Setting up a sample vulnerable web application that is prone to parameter tampering attacks. This will serve as a testbed for demonstrations.
-	Performing controlled attacks on the sample application as well as live production websites using tools like Burp Suite to manipulate parameters and illustrate real-world attack techniques.
-	Implementing cryptographic defenses including AES and RSA encryption algorithms to encrypt parameter data, protecting its integrity.
-	Using SHA-512 and other hash functions to fingerprint and validate parameters.
-	Developing improved session generation, handling, and termination mechanisms such as tokens and timeouts to mitigate session-based attacks.
-	Analyzing the effectiveness of the implemented defenses by conducting penetration testing and tampering attempts on the protected application.
-	Comparing the cryptographic protections to alternative mitigation strategies like whitelist input validation and tighter account controls.
-	Creating demonstrations, documentation, guides, and sample code focused specifically on risks of parameter tampering and their mitigations.
-	Staying within scope of web application threats by not expanding into other injection attacks like SQLi and XSS
